# Cars Hub

Welcome to Cars Hub, my first web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, Headless UI, and Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to search for cars by their names and check rental information. Additionally, users can apply filters based on the year the car was made and the type of fuel (electric or gas).

## Features

- **Search Cars**: Easily search for cars by their names.
- **Rental Information**: View rental details for each car.
- **Filters**: Filter cars based on:
  - Year of manufacture
  - Type of fuel (Electric or Gas)

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Headless UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI components designed for Tailwind CSS.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
